# Intro to Ansible
**Definition/Overview:** Ansible is an open-source collection of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) automation tools and a declarative language for making and managing system configurations, app deployments, and software provisions, providing orchestration of both app lifecycle and workflow. It describes app infrastructure via Ansible 'playbooks', which its automation engine executes. Ansible provides readily human readable automation services, enabling systems to be reliably productive and execute processes sequentially/as defined. Its agentless architecture provides both simple efficiency and security, without a need for constant updates.
